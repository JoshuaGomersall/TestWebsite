<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>
I started an interest for IT during the end of college, during this time VR and AR had started becoming larger and more commonly used amongst the games industry. VR was the main focus of my final year at university and is still a passion of mine after, the continual expansion of new technologies and their integration into industry is the main reason for my continual enjoyment and excitement of IT.

During the end of 2017 to 2018 I worked on 2 main projects outside of university ,the 1st was a VR Project and the 2nd was a AR project designed around teaching children languages.
