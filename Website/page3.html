<h2>Prior To QA Consulting – Consultant </h2>
<h3>Project Manager / Testing History</h3> 
<p>
During 2018 I spent some of my time working both as a project manager and testing manager for a product developed and designed for a primary school in saltire to teach children languages. 
During the end of 2017 I worked as part of group called GebbaGames to produce and test a VR game for the oculus and vive ,we got to showcase the game at EGX Birmingham 2017 with 80,000 attendees.

<h2>QA Consulting – Consultant</h2>  
<h3>NB Gardens</h3>
<p>
The project was asked around a case study of a company called NB Gardens they sell gnomes and other garden based products and used a paper based system to track orders. During this case study I gained valuable skills relevant to interviewing and gathering information for a variety of people with differing levels of knowledge relevant to the subject topic. During this project I worked with a team to produce and present a slide deck detailing problems with the company and how they could be fixed to the client. 
Java I worked on several different types of small projects using the Eclipse IDE and coding in Java to produce programs that would calculate the most cost effective from several items ,sort items based on the cheapest and calculate the change you would get after paying for those items ,all of these programs were tested with or developing by using TDD .I also gained basic knowledge of how to use the Eclipse Swing plugin to design a UI for my programs to test.
